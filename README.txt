I didn't use many resources for this project as I had previous experience with Android Studio
All that was really necessary was for me to refresh myself on a few things like resource files, colors, and buttons
I did look back on one of my previous Android Studio projects (the AboutMe project) for reference on how to do certain things
I was already pretty familiar with the UI builder in Android Studio so I simply modified the empty activity template to do this project
I'm fairly comfortable with using the constraint layout so I used that to arrange the buttons in the XML layout file
I manually edited the XML file when I needed to change the text inside buttons or the color of buttons, since it was easier to do there
I didn't really hit any roadblocks and as far as I know I don't have any unresolved bugs in my code
